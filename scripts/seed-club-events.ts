// Also adds the upcoming events listed in UPCOMING (open for registration; created once, never overwritten).
// Adds the club's past events (major events and club hours) as published entries, closed for registration and
// marked "date to be announced", so no date is made up. Fill in the real dates afterwards in
// Portal -> Admin -> Events & reservations (Edit).
// Safe to re-run: an existing event gets its title, type and description refreshed, and keeps its date, team size
// and everything else. A date that was set in the admin screen is never touched.
